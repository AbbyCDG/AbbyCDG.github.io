		<h2 id="hobbies" font face="futura">Hobbies and Interests</h2>
		<p>My main hobbie for when I have free time is to watch Netflix. My favorite shoes as of right now is Scandal, which I highly reccomend, Grey's Anotamy and Bob's Burgers. For me having a fit life is the best type of life, so that's why I have upper body training, lower body training and my boxing life, sometimes it's horrible especially when I have all 3 on the same day. I love to skateboard when I have free time I'm not that great at trick I just prefer cruising. The last thing is that I love to play baseball and softball, I've been playing baseball since I could even hold a bat and as soon as I swung at the first ball my dad threw to me I fell in love with the sport and been playing ever since. </p>
		<h2 id="skills"font face="futura">Skills</h2>
		<p >I would'nt say i'm a skillful person or at least, there is alot more people with a lot more skill sets than me. I feel like I got most of my skills from school. For example this website that im coding I learned in my ATM class. In the winter my family and I usually go to the mountains and either go snowboard or skiing which is super fun if you actually know how to do it. When you don't know how to do that's a completley different story. I've learned a lot in ATM for example i've learned how to make movies, music,code, and how to do photoshop. At sometimes it's really fun but sometimes it can get really stressful and annoying, but overall i've learned alot and I want to learn more. </p>

		<h2 id="highschool">Highschool/ Career Goals</h2>
		<p>The number 1 highschool I want to is CAMS but of course that is for the super smart people and I'm not super smart I'm hardley average, so I decided that Mcbride might be a good school for me. </p>
		<p>The main reason why I want to go to Mcbride is because I want to become a doctor. I want to specialize in nuero or become a truama surgeon. I don't exactly what type of doctor I want to be for example I want to be a veternarian but It's a lot harder because we need to know more anatomys, but if I become a doctor just 1 anatomy. </p>
		<p>I also would'nt mind working for the government, I don't ever want to be The President of the United States of America, I would'nt be a leader of the free world. I would want to be the chief of staff it may not seem like an important job but it's one of the most important jobs you can have in the White House.</p>
		<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
		<p>My main goal is to have a family and grow old with a man who loves me. I'm also determined to become a doctor I'll do whatever it takes to become a doctor, I want to save lives. I want to make my parents proud and give all I can, back to them. My dad wants a 1976 1/2 mustang either red or baby blue and if I make enough money I'll give him both of the cars. I want to give my mom her dream car too and it's a woodie so hopfully I can give her the car she's always wanted.</p>
