		<p>The number 1 highschool I want to is CAMS but of course that is for the super smart people and I'm not super smart I'm hardley average, so I decided that Mcbride might be a good school for me. </p>
		<p>The main reason why I want to go to Mcbride is because I want to become a doctor. I want to specialize in nuero or become a truama surgeon. I don't exactly what type of doctor I want to be for example I want to be a veternarian but It's a lot harder because we need to know more anatomys, but if I become a doctor just 1 anatomy. </p>
		<p>I also would'nt mind working for the government, I don't ever want to be The President of the United States of America, I would'nt be a leader of the free world. I would want to be the chief of staff it may not seem like an important job but it's one of the most important jobs you can have in the White House.</p>

		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>My main goal is to have a family & grow old with a man who loves me. I'm also determined to become a doctor I'll do whatever it takes to become a doctor, I want to save lives. I want to make my parents proud and give all I can, back to them. My dad wants a 1976 1/2 mustang either red or baby blue and if I make enough money I'll give him both of the cars. I want to give my mom her dream car too and it's a woodie so hopfully I can give her the car she's always wanted.</p>
